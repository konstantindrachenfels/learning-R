I took the course "Coding dynamic dashboard applications" where I learned how to build web-app dashboards in R based on R Shiny. This was a very intense 2-month course in which I easily invested 25h/week to truly learn R.
I ended up building a dashboard based on a dataset of Google Play Store Apps. The app can be found here: https://kdrachenfels.shinyapps.io/Google_Play_Store_Apps/ .
I learned how to source, clean, analyze & visualize datasets using the libraries tidyverse/tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2 (ggthemes, gganimate, ...), plotly, shiny & shinydashboard. I also learned how to share my findings in a professional manner using RMarkdown.
